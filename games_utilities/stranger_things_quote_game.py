"""
Problem: Stranger Things Quote Guessing Game
--------------------------------------------
We want to fetch a random quote from the Stranger Things Quotes API and let 
the user guess who said it.

Approach:
1. Make an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint.
2. Parse the JSON response and extract the quote and author.
3. Display the quote and ask the user to guess who said it.
4. Compare the userâ€™s guess with the correct author.
   - If correct â†’ print a win message.
   - If incorrect â†’ reveal the correct answer.
