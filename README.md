# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains all the Python files, mini-projects, and practice exercises I created while learning Python. It’s a collection of small programs, data structure implementations, and problem-solving attempts that helped me build my foundations in Python.

## Repository Structure
The repo is organized into folders for clarity:

- **algorithms/**
- **data_structures/**  
- **file_io/**  
- **games_utensils/**
- **iterators_generators/**
- **numpy/**
- **oop/**
- **python_features/** 

## Data Files
Some scripts rely on input files. Here’s where they’re used:  
- `nyc_weather.csv` → Weather-related Python exercises (file handling)  
- `list.csv` → CSV file handling practice  
- `input.txt` → Text file reading/writing practice  
- `input.json` → JSON parsing practice  
- `input.csv` → CSV handling practice  
- `movies.csv`→ Pandas practice
- `bengaluru_house_prices.csv`→ Pandas practice

## Purpose
The goal of this repo is to:  
- Document my Python learning journey  
- Keep track of all the small programs I’ve written  
- Show my growth in problem-solving and coding  

## Future Plans
- Add more advanced algorithms and data structures  
- Explore OOP projects in Python  
- Practice real-world file handling and APIs

*This repo isn’t meant to be polished projects—it’s a showcase of the small steps I took while learning Python.*
